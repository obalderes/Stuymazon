Welcome to STUYMAZON, the official buying and selling site for the Stuyvesant community. STUYMAZON provides students with an easy to use, extensive mode of exchange for everything from AP review books to sneakers in mint condition.

<ul> - put items up for sale </ul>
<ul> - bid on items that have been put up for sale </ul>
<ul> - create a post that specifies an item they are interested in buying</ul>
<ul> - respond to an item request </ul>
<ul> - build and expand their STUYMAZON profile </ul>
